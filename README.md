| **Favorites Management** | Allows users to save preferred currency pairs for quick access. | **Sets** (for uniqueness), **Web Storage** |
| **Market Insights Panel** | Displays dynamic rate changes and manages a user-defined list with a **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** limit of 3 pairs. | **Promises**, **Objects** (FIFO logic), **Concurrency Management** |
| **Historical Analysis** | Dedicated page for fetching and visualizing time-series data. | **Classes**, **Inheritance**, **Chart.js** |

## üíª Technical Concept Checklist

This project fulfills all required technical objectives across the codebase:

| Concept | Status | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Classes & Inheritance** | Integrated | `HistoricalRateService` extends `BaseService` (`HistoricalService.js`). |
| **Constructor Functions** | Integrated | Used to model structured `HistoryRecord` objects. |
| **Promises & Async/Await**| Integrated | Used in all data fetching methods (`convertCurrency`, `populateMarketPanel`). |
| **Destructuring & Loops** | Integrated | Used for rendering History and Market panels (`const { amount, from } = record;`). |
| **Spread and Rest Operators**| Integrated | Used in utility functions and when managing array/object mutations. |
| **Hoisting** | Integrated | Demonstrated via `function declaration` for `saveHistory`. |
